# Chat_bot
1st Git hub project and project in Python. I will be trying to be making a full-stack chatbot with a website to access it and hopefully also have an option on said website to use it on Discord.

Make multiple levels of chat_bot, starting with a simple chatbot with preset answers, then have one that learns from the user, and then one that uses neural networks.
